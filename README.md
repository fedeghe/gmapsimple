# Gmaps3simple

Almost 10 years ago I developed a utility library to easily manage google maps with php.

[There](https://www.phpclasses.org/package/7191-PHP-Display-interactive-maps-with-Google-Maps-3-API.html) 
is the original class, after a long time I got a request from a user (big surprise) 
asking me to allow setting the google `api_key`, was not even needed back then. Now there it is:  
```
$instance->set_api_key('YOUR_API_KEY')
```

some of the features used in the sample are not working exactly as expected, but I plan to refactor that and maybe publish a brand new version.
